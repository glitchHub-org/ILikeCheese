  <div class="middle" style="background-color:#bbb;">Call me Skip, I'm your local "efficient" guy on the class, born during October 26, 1999 at Villiamor Air base hospital in Pasay City, I just pass freshmen year by a thread since I barely studied for everything, I spent my summer staying up till 7 am while playing games like Rainbow Six Siege, Arma 3, Minecraft  and City Skylines, or watch binge watch some YouTube videos on whatever I felt watching on those time like some facts about the German 3rd Reich or Vietnam war, some facts on some animals or just YouTubers doing stupid things. 
  Since during summer had a Gun Ban, I can't go out and play airsoft with my friends, making my summer kinda boring since I never leave my house for a bit. 
  For all of the things I have done, I haven't done a thing that's well attached or will leave a memorable experience, for now I just like to go with the flow and don't get way too caught up with something emotional that either 
  someone might get hurt. 
	
  For my expectations on this class is just simple, have a nice and smooth lessons that everyone can process easily, like how to use and/or create a UI for an application either for a mobile device or PC.
